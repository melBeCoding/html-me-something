<h1>Learning to Do Better</h1>                                                                                                                    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/da/eb/42/daeb42ca20499f4f6fc83efa0c57e7b2.jpg" alt="Laugh Now, Cry Later" width="500" height="500">
<p> One thing I would say I am trying to work on this class is discipline. Since I have started LC101, I have learned so much. I literally have to challenge myself all day and use my will power to get things done. I am grateful to be in this program and sometimes have a hard time at showing it. I need to take better advantage of my oppertunities and grow from my mistakes.
I am going to turn this all around and do better for myself and prove to myself that I would not let negativity, doubts and outside factors distract me again.</p> 
<h2> Things that hold me back</h2>
<p> I know I am capable of doing this work and possible being successful at it. I am always playing Ket-Chup in life. 
I suprise myself when I make it through tough times because I don't feel like I put much effort into certain things. This is good and bad because it proves I have the potential
to make it, but I could do better. I can spend time helping others instead of wasting time being selfish and unproductive. I could stop speeding through things and take my time to actually retain
all the information I learned. But most of all, I could be more organized or at least organize my own chaos. <p/> 
<article> Ket-Chup is my favorite condiment, might be the reason I like playing it. </article> 
<h2>Outside Factors</h2> 
<p> My life is full of melodramatics. I have alot of very small problems that cause bigger problems in my life. My family can be very needy and often distract me with their requests and 
"need for care". They take me away from the time I need to work on my projects. I try to get them to understand that I can not be there for them all the time. I plan on making sure to set clear 
boundaries with my family. I have transportation issues as well and work overnights. I do not have a car and often need to get around but, carpooling with someone who feels the same often 
clashes schedules. I am learning to be more independent and focus on trying to eliminate these outside factors <p/>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am stumbling but, I have not fallen. I am ready to reset my goals &amp; revamp my mindset. I could not let myself let my this oppertunity slip away from me. A mind is a terrible thig to waste 
and I plan on filling mines with love and knowledge.</p>
